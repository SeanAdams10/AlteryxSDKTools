- Take the tool folder and zip it so that the first folder underneath it is <myToolName>
- Into the root of the zip - add the config.xml
- Make sure that your files are named correctly in your tool:
    <myToolName>Engine
    <myToolName>Gui
    <myToolName>Icon
    <myToolName>Config
    ... and the folder name has to be the same as <myToolName>
